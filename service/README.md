# Water Watcher Service

This project provides a systemd service for managing the `water_watcher.py` script, which monitors water levels and can control a smart plug based on the detected water status.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd water-watcher-service
   ```

2. **Copy the service file** to the systemd directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp water-watcher.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

3. **Reload systemd** to recognize the new service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

## Usage

### Enable the Service

To enable the service to start on boot, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable water-watcher.service
```

### Start the Service

To start the service immediately, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl start water-watcher.service
```

### Check the Status

To check the status of the service, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl status water-watcher.service
```

### Stop the Service

To stop the service, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop water-watcher.service
```

### View Logs

To view logs generated by the service, use:
```bash
journalctl -u water-watcher.service
```

## Configuration

Make sure to set the necessary environment variables for the Telegram and Leviton configurations before starting the service. You can do this by adding them to your system's environment or modifying the service file to include them.

## Notes

- Ensure that the required Python packages are installed and that the script has the necessary permissions to access GPIO pins and network resources.
- Modify the `water-watcher.service` file as needed to adjust the user, working directory, or execution command based on your setup.
